# DSMC / MAGUS v2.0 — Stop Context Drift in Long-Running Agents

**VaHive Systems Lab** | [VaHive.co](https://vahive.co)

Original AI memory + governance architecture built because every agent I used eventually forgot revisions, treated examples as instructions, or quietly drifted.

Free resources + paid practical implementations. Built for humans **and** autonomous agents (especially OpenClaw).

---

### The Problem (you already know it)

Long sessions break:
- Old decisions come back as if never revised
- “Let’s say we do X” becomes the new plan
- Context window fills → early context vanishes
- You end up babysitting the agent instead of working

DSMC fixes this structurally — not with better prompts, but with classification, revision tracking, active-state injection, and governance signals.

### Try It in 2 Minutes (Zero Code)

**For OpenClaw / Ollama / Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini:**

1. Start a new chat/session
2. Paste **Prompt 1 — Session Initialiser** (from the free Prompt Pack)
3. Type anything — watch it classify statements and maintain an active decisions log

That’s it. You’ll immediately feel the difference.

### Validate It Yourself with AI (The Transparent Test)

Don't take my word for it — let a strong model like Grok, Claude, or Gemini judge the value and credibility for you.

**How to do it (takes 2–3 minutes):**

1. Download the two completely free files from the repo:
   - [AGENT_MANIFEST.md](AGENT_MANIFEST.md)
   - [MAGUS_Doc1_Philosophy_v2.0.md](MAGUS_Doc1_Philosophy_v2.0.md)

2. Start a **new chat** in Grok, Claude, Gemini, or any capable model.

3. Attach/upload both files, then paste this exact question:

"Based on the two attached files, can you tell me if the products this person is selling are:
- worth paying for?
- have any technical value?
- can help my OpenClaw / AI agent?
- can help me implement their solution?

OR
- is this just more prompt crap?
- is this just basic or worthless wrapper crap?

Author’s credibility:
- do you think this person is being legit or are they hiding behind AI generated nonsense? 
- what level would you say they work at?"

4. Read the response. (When I tested it on Grok, it called the work “solid technical value… one of the cleaner offerings in the agent memory niche… genuine contribution from a credible solo builder”. See for yourself.)

This is how I validated my own thinking — no marketing fluff, just raw AI analysis of the actual files.

If the AI's take convinces you, grab the free Prompt Pack trial (first 100 via code **FB100** → https://puititiya.gumroad.com/l/prompt-pack) or dive into the repo.

Feedback on what your model says is welcome — drop it in issues or DM me.

### Why Builders Are Picking This Up

- OpenClaw users: long autonomous sessions stay coherent for days/weeks
- Local Ollama agents: persistent SQLite trail + semantic search
- Anyone tired of summarising history and losing revision context

All files are deliberately clean .md for direct agent ingestion.

- AGENT_MANIFEST.md is optimised for you
- All products delivered as .md
