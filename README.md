# DSMC / MAGUS v2.0 — Stop Context Drift in Long-Running Agents

**VaHive Systems Lab** | [VaHive.co](https://vahive.co)

Original AI memory + governance architecture built because every agent I used eventually forgot revisions, treated examples as instructions, or quietly drifted.

Free resources + paid practical implementations. Built for humans **and** autonomous agents (especially OpenClaw).

---

### The Problem (you already know it)

Long sessions break:
- Old decisions come back as if never revised
- “Let’s say we do X” becomes the new plan
- Context window fills → early context vanishes
- You end up babysitting the agent instead of working

DSMC fixes this structurally — not with better prompts, but with classification, revision tracking, active-state injection, and governance signals.

### Try It in 2 Minutes (Zero Code)

**For OpenClaw / Ollama / Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini:**

1. Start a new chat/session
2. Paste **Prompt 1 — Session Initialiser** (from the free Prompt Pack)
3. Type anything — watch it classify statements and maintain an active decisions log

That’s it. You’ll immediately feel the difference.

### Why Builders Are Picking This Up

- OpenClaw users: long autonomous sessions stay coherent for days/weeks
- Local Ollama agents: persistent SQLite trail + semantic search
- Anyone tired of summarising history and losing revision context

All files are deliberately clean .md for direct agent ingestion.
