### Why this exists

I built DSMC/MAGUS because every long-running agent I used (OpenClaw, local
Ollama, etc.) eventually drifted — old decisions resurfaced, examples became
instructions, revisions were forgotten.

This suite is the complete fix: philosophy → architecture → operations →
governance → ready-to-run code (prompt, API, and fully local SQLite versions).

All files are delivered as clean **PDF + .md** so you can read them or drop
them straight into your LLM/agent.
